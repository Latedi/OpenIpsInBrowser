# OpenIpsInBrowser
Open a list of IP addresses in your browser

Preferably use chrome because that's what this script is verified to be working with.


How to use:

Replace the path variable in the script with your browser's.

The path also has to use \"/\" and not \"\\\"."

You could also modify the bp variable to change the amount of windows to open at once.


Examples:

python openips.py list.txt

python openips.py list.txt https
